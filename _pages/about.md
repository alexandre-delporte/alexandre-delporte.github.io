This is my personal website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). I am a PhD student in laboratory Jean-Kuntzmann in Grenoble, supervised by [Adeline Samson](http://adeline.e-samson.org/). I am part of the [SVH](https://svh.imag.fr/) team in the [DATA](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/spip.php?article6)  department of the laboratory. My work is focues on statistics, state-space models, mixed-effect-models and stochastic differential equations applied to movement ecology. I also collaborate with [Susanne Ditlevsen](https://web.math.ku.dk/~susanne/).
